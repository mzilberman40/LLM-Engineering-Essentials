## 📹 Our event calendar — join online

How do you build multi-agent systems using open standards? **On June 25**, we’re going to find out!

**Nebius Academy is hosting a live, expert-led Building Multi-Agent Systems with Open Standards webinar with Rod Rivera, DevRel at Jentic, AI Product Engineer, Professor of AI at ITAM, and an influencer.**

👉[Join the webinar](https://nebius.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_um7T4Gl6RJGcF-GKRo5Aig#/registration)

You'll learn:

✔️ How to create agentic workflows that are not only machine-readable and testable — but also easy to understand.

✔️ How open standards like OpenAPI and Arazzo help design, orchestrate, and maintain complex AI systems.

## 🎓 What is this course about?

## 📌 Quick start

Get hands-on with LLM APIs and self-hosted models as you code, experiment, and build your own platform for custom AI-powered NPCs.

This 12-week course, created by experts from academia and industry, is designed specifically for developers and engineers. You’ll have a chance to get guidance from experienced pros, join regular Q&A sessions to stay on track, and connect with peers along the way.

Materials for each topic can be found in the ./topic* folders. See README.md for further details and instructions.

Any technical issues, ideas, bugs in course materials, contribution ideas - add an issue.

### Topic 6️⃣ Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning of LLMs and embeddings. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and LoRA. RLHF and DPO
	
**Project**: Making your characters even more alive through fine-tuning

## 🏗️ NPC Factory Project

During the course, you'll build a platform that serves intelligent, believable, reactive, and autonomous NPCs — non-player characters at the heart of immersive games, driving engaging interactions and making worlds feel rich and dynamic.

- Deploy models on real servers and integrate them into game environments.
- Implement agentic capabilities, enabling NPCs to set goals and adapt dynamically.
- Build scalable APIs to support complex game interactions.
- Optimize performance, monitor behavior, and fine-tune models for smooth, responsive gameplay.
